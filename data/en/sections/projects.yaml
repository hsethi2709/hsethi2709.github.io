# - name: Who Tweeted That? - Authorship Attribution
#   role: Contributor
#   repo: https://github.com/hsethi2709/Who-Tweeted-That-
#   summary: For the task of author identification we took into consideration and analysed various machine learning classification models to single out authors for the collected Twitter data set. Alongside the models feature engineering was also applied. Various models were considered, such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest and neural network multi-class classifiers and how and why they performed under this particular task was reported. In the end, we found that LinearSVC outperformed all the other models by achieving 29% accuracy.
